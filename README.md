[Jeff Bezos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos)

Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen was born on January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to a teenage mother, Jacklyn Gise Jorgensen, and father Ted Jorgensen, a bike shop owner and Chicago native.[5] At the time of her son's birth, Jacklyn was a seventeen-year-old high school student.[6] After Jacklyn divorced Ted, she married Miguel "Mike" Bezos, a Cuban immigrant, in April 1968.[7] Shortly after the wedding, Mike Bezos adopted four-year-old Jorgensen, whose surname was then changed to Bezos.[8] The family moved to Houston, where Mike worked as an engineer for Exxon after he received a degree from the University of New Mexico.[9] Bezos attended River Oaks Elementary School in Houston from fourth to sixth grade.[10]
